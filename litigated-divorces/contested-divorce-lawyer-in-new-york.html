                            </p><h2>Why Hire a Contested Divorce Lawyer in New York</h2><p>When a couple cannot agree on the terms of their divorce, such as property division, visitation, custody, and spousal support, it can become contested. Hiring a <a href="https://www.besinquelaw.com/contested-divorce-attorneys-new-york/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">contested divorce lawyer in New York</a> can help both parties break the stalemate and work towards an equitable solution that benefits everyone involved.
<br>
<br>A contested divorce can be complex, especially when both sides refuse to compromise or communicate. This can result in extended litigation procedures and higher legal fees, as well as increased stress for both spouses involved. A contested divorce can also become more contentious if one spouse is manipulative or engaging in bad-faith tactics. A contested divorce lawyer in New York is crucial in navigating these challenging dynamics effectively.
<br>
<br>Often, the biggest issue in a divorce case is property division. Each party is entitled to a share of the marital assets, including cash, investments, retirement funds, and personal property. Unfortunately, some couples cannot agree on how to divide these assets and may end up in a lengthy and stressful court battle. Working with a contested divorce lawyer in New York can significantly influence the equitable division of these assets.
<br>
<br>Child custody and spousal support are other common issues that can become heated in a contested divorce. The state of New York has an established formula for determining child and spousal support, but both parties must be aware that this is not necessarily the final word on these issues. A skilled contested divorce lawyer in New York can help you reach an agreement with your partner that is fair and equitable to both of you, even if it means going to trial.
<br>
<br>Many of our clients come to us seeking a divorce, but their spouses oppose the idea of ending the marriage. This can be due to hope for reconciliation, religious beliefs, or cultural traditions. In some cases, our clients are facing a contested divorce because their spouses are incarcerated or unable to return to the home for various reasons. In these situations, having a contested divorce lawyer in New York on your side can be especially beneficial to navigate the legal complexities.
<br>
<br>No matter the reason, when a spouse is unwilling to cooperate or compromise, it can be extremely difficult to get the divorce you want. A contested divorce can be a lengthy and expensive process, but with the right guidance from an experienced lawyer, you may be able to get what you deserve. We are dedicated to helping our clients move forward with their lives as quickly and smoothly as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                            </p><h2>Understanding Contested Divorce Proceedings in New York</h2><p>A divorce is usually a complicated process for many couples, and a couple may not be able to agree on important issues such as property division, child custody, and alimony. When a couple cannot reach an agreement on these issues, they may file for a contested divorce. Hiring a contested divorce lawyer in New York can help individuals navigate this challenging process and determine whether this is the best option for their case.
<br>
<br>To initiate a contested divorce in New York, one or both parties must submit a summons and complaint to the court. In addition, a request for judicial intervention must also be filed. Both of these forms are available from the clerk’s office, and they can be downloaded from the state website. After submitting the required documents, it is necessary to have them personally served upon your spouse by someone who meets the requirements for service of process in New York. This can be a friend, family member, or professional process server. Once the documents are successfully delivered, they must be filed with the clerk’s office. A contested divorce lawyer in New York can ensure that all documents are correctly filed and served.
<br>
<br>Several different reasons can lead to a contested divorce in New York. For example, a couple may disagree on how to divide their assets, including real estate, retirement accounts, bank accounts, and other household items. They may also disagree on the types and amounts of spousal support they should receive, as well as whether or not they need child custody or visitation rights. In some cases, a contested divorce is the only way to get a resolution to these disputes. With the guidance of a contested divorce lawyer in New York, you can effectively address these disagreements.
<br>
<br>When it comes to dividing marital assets, New York is an “equitable distribution” state, which means that the courts will decide what is fair rather than what each party wants. In most cases, this means that assets will be divided equally, although there are some exceptions. However, the judge will consider many other factors when determining what is fair, such as the length of the marriage, each party’s current financial status and future prospects, and tax consequences. Consulting with a contested divorce lawyer in New York can help you understand how these factors might affect your case.
<br>
<br>There are some cases in which a contested divorce is not necessary or appropriate. For example, if the parties can come to an agreement on all issues, then they can pursue an uncontested divorce in New York. This will be faster and less expensive than a contested divorce, which can make it a better option for some individuals. However, it is essential to have the representation of a contested divorce lawyer in New York even in seemingly straightforward situations to ensure all aspects are legally sound.
<br>
<br>It is important to note that the divorce process can be emotionally and financially draining for a couple, especially if it is lengthy and contentious. It is critical to consult with an experienced lawyer to ensure that your legal rights are protected throughout the process. An attorney can assist you with filing all the required and optional paperwork, as well as interpreting complex legal terminology. Incorrectly completing these forms can have serious consequences, and an attorney can also provide insight into the possible outcomes of your case. This can help you to make the best decision for your situation and avoid complications in the future.&nbsp;<br></p>

                            </p><h2>Filing Divorce Petitions in New York</h2><p>Whether you and your spouse agree to get divorced or not, there are certain forms that need to be filed with the court. Depending on your situation, these forms will be different and could include requests for things like child custody, support, or property division. You will also have to file some financial disclosure forms, such as those related to assets and debts. Unless you are granted a waiver based on income, you will also need to pay filing fees when submitting your paperwork. Consulting a contested divorce lawyer in New York during this initial phase can provide crucial guidance on accurately completing and filing these forms.
<br>
<br>Once you have all of your forms filled out, the next step is to deliver or "serve" them on your spouse. This can be done in a variety of ways, including by hiring a professional process server to do so for a fee. Alternatively, you can ask a trusted friend or family member to do it for you. This person must also complete a simple form called an Affidavit of Service attesting that they did indeed pass the divorce papers to your spouse. It's advisable to discuss the serving process with a contested divorce lawyer in New York to ensure compliance with state laws.
<br>
<br>After receiving the divorce papers, your spouse will either sign an Affidavit of Defendant saying that they agree with everything you put in the Summons or they may decide to file what's known as an Answer disagreeing with at least one thing in the Summons. If they choose to do this, then your case will become a contested divorce. A contested divorce lawyer in New York can help you navigate the complexities of such disagreements and advise on the best legal strategies.
<br>
<br>In either case, your case will need to be put on the Supreme Court calendar so that a judge can review all of your paperwork. This is where the discovery process will begin, which can take some time before you reach a final settlement. The assistance of a contested divorce lawyer in New York is crucial during the discovery process to ensure that all relevant information is properly disclosed and that your rights are protected.
<br>
<br>The final judgment will likely contain details about all of the assets that you and your spouse have together, the property you each own separately, and the debts that were incurred during the marriage. It will also include any support payments that were agreed upon. This is why it is so important to have a lawyer review all of the paperwork prior to filing. A contested divorce lawyer in New York will be able to ensure that the final judgment reflects a fair and equitable division of assets and responsibilities.
<br>
<br>Some couples choose to pursue a fault-based divorce, which involves laying out the reasons you want to split up. For example, you can use the grounds of cruel treatment, abandonment, adultery, or incompatibility. This does tend to take longer and cost more than a no fault divorce, but it can be a very satisfying way to end your marriage. However, it is not always necessary to go this route. A qualified attorney can help you decide what the best course of action is for your individual situation.&nbsp;<br></p>
