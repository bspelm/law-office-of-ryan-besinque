  <meta name="description" content="What is a contested divorce? Each divorce case is unique. While some cases can be handled amicably through the cooperative efforts of the couple, some can be emotionally charged due to the couple’s personal circumstances. In New York, divorce laws allow for two types of divorce: contested and uncontested. The type of divorce you get depends on whether you and your spouse can work through your differences and agree on the major concerns of your divorce without needing court intervention.">

                            </p><h2>Understanding Contested Divorce in New York</h2><p>The complexity of the divorce process can be challenging for spouses and their families. A variety of legal issues can arise, and it is often helpful to have an experienced attorney to guide you through the proceedings. In New York, there are two main types of divorce: contested and uncontested. Understanding <a href="https://www.besinquelaw.com/contested-vs-uncontested-divorce-what-is-the-difference/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">what is a contested divorce</a> can help you determine which option is best for your situation.
<br>
<br>If both parties agree on all of the major issues pertaining to their divorce, then an uncontested divorce may be appropriate for them. This is typically a less costly option and can be completed through mutual cooperation and amicable negotiation. 
<br>
<br>On the other hand, what is a contested divorce is one in which spouses disagree on several crucial issues, including property division, child custody and support. Spouses that cannot reach a settlement on these issues will require a trial to resolve the conflict. Understanding what is a contested divorce is crucial for spouses who find themselves unable to agree on key divorce-related matters.
<br>
<br>Spouses will need to present their side of the story before a judge in a contested divorce, and they will have to provide evidence and documentation to support their claims. For example, if a spouse claims that the other party has not maintained proper financial records or has been hiding assets, then they will need to produce documentation of these claims. Knowing what is a contested divorce helps prepare spouses for the rigorous process of presenting their case in court.
<br>
<br>Another issue that commonly arises in what is a contested divorce is disagreement over alimony. New York law sets forth a formula for calculating spousal maintenance, but this may not accurately reflect your specific circumstances. Our team can work diligently to help you obtain the spousal support that you deserve in a contested divorce.
<br>
<br>The final issue that frequently leads to contested divorces is the dispute over property division and asset allocation. New York is an equitable distribution state, which means that marital property should be fairly divided between the spouses. This does not necessarily mean that the property will be split down the middle; instead, it should be distributed based on factors such as the parties’ goals, interests and needs. In addition, the courts will also attempt to divide debt equitably. Understanding what is a contested divorce is key to navigating the complexities of asset division in divorce proceedings.
